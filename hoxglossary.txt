Ever wonder what a [I]Rosie[/I] is?  Ever wonder if someone is slaying a [I]snapdragon[/I]?  Ever wonder why someone would want to [I]desense[/I] a ROM?  If you're like me, your first few weeks parusing the forums for your shiny new HTC One X was frought with strange words and terms that make you wonder if they're talking about an Android device or a Disney movie.  But even after those first few weeks, you finally feel comfortable with the vernacular, and wouldn't you know it but a new word comes up!

The purpose of this thread is to capture the definitions of words and terms that come up frequently in discussions of ROMs and MODs specifically for the HTC One X/XL.  General terms like "RUU" and "TWRC" will not normally be defined here, unless there is something specific or innate to the HTC One XL.  The idea is that when questions about these terms come up in discussions that one need only reply with a link to this thread.  Please reply to this thread to suggest terms for inclusion or point out corrections and omissions in the definitions themselves.  However, please do [I]not[/I] use this thread to [I]ask[/I] questions... start a new thread in the Q&A forum for that, optionally linking back to this thread.
